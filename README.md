## 3.Pewlett-Hackard Summary

* The number of roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact is: 72,458.
* 
* Looking at the count across tiles, yes it looks like there are enough qualified, retirement ready employees to mentor, At an average we can around 18,000 employees for each birth year excluding 1965. But looking at data from 1965 birth year the count eligible for mentorship is less. This could attribute either to a data issue with incomplete data as the counts for 1965 is very less with no additional years or reality that this was the state at that time.
